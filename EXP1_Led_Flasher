Concept:   Concept of Arduino ,Loops concept,Basics of C language so that coding of Arduino can be written.

Learning and Observations:
                            The Observations made are that the LED flahes when connnected to the Arduino as the it provides a paticular voltage 
                            to LED complte the circit.The CODE written when uploaded to the Arduino hardware it the follows the code provided 
                            and functins accordingly.

Problems and Troubleshooting:
                             
                             The problems faced during the circuit and Arduino hardware is that sometimes the second wire is not connected 
                             to the ground and so the circuit do not functions.the Troubleshoot for this problem is proper wiring.
                             
                             Problems in the code happens mostly in assigning the terminal number in the code  and so the program does not
                             get stimulated and sometimes LOW function when not assigned also causes trouble.
                             
                             When the IDE shows error while compiling the code.Always check that path and model of Arduino is correctly set
                             to the Correct model of Arduino hardware used.
                             
Precautions:                 Various precautions can be taken during this like ensuring proper connection of wires around LED,resitor,Arduino
                             and check path and model set to Arduino UNO3 in the Arduino IDE.

Outcomes:                    The outcomes of the project is that the LED flashes accordingly to the code uploded to the arduino and the output
                             can be changed by doing some changes in the code and uploading it.We can even set the time for delay for glow 
                             of the LED.
