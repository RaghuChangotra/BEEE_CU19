###Theory-->
      CONCEPT-->> Basics of Arduino , if Conditional Statements,Connection of devices like PushButton,LED with Arduino.
                  Usage of TinkerCAD and Connections.
      
      
      
      LEARNING AND OBSERVATIONS-->> I Observed that When the almirah's door gets opened then the Pushbutton attached to that door gets
                                    pressed and it Switches on the LED and that LED most importantly remains on until the PushButton 
                                    is released by closing the door.
                                    I Understood the concept of controlling the LED with PushButton and connection of Arduino with this
                                    Apparatus.
      
      
      PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING -->> The problem which occured during this experiment was that during connection of wires the LED 
                                        got the reverse biasing and so it was not glowing .Another problem occured that during the 
                                        connection with the pushbutton grounding was not given to it.Connect the wires to the pushButton
                                        Correctly.
                                        
      PRECAUTIONS-->>                   Check all the connections are correct . Place the setup in a stable form so that the experiment 
                                        goes without any trouble.Check all the equipments are working including Arduino and the cable.
     
      
      LEARNING OUTCOMES --> Alot of learning outcomes came .I learned about that how we take a reading from a device using digitalRead()
                            Also I learned that Always first draw a rough sketch of your circuit before connecting the actual things 
                            which would decrease the danger of any shortcircuit or shortwiring.
